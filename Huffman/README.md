# Huffman encoding and decoding
## Launch: 
### Encode: node huffman.js encode in.txt table.json out.txt
in.txt - txt file with text
table.json - name of json file where table will be stored
out.txt - txt file where encoded sequence will be saved
### Decode: node huffman.js decode out.txt table.json res.txt
out.txt - encoded sequence
table.json - previously saved table
res.txt - file where decoded sequence will be saved
